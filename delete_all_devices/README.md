# Delete all devices

Well.. this will go an delete all your devices. 
Be careful! Because it will... delete all your devices from CDO, only to be reonboarded again as needed.

 
```
export OAUTH=my_API_token

bash delete_all_devices.sh 
```

Now, think again if you really want to run this. And good luck, have a great day.
